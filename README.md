# Bingo Hanouna

![language](https://img.shields.io/badge/logo-javascript-blue?logo=javascript)

Bingo Hanouna is a project inspired by the TV show "Touche Pas Ã  Mon Poste!" (TPMP) and its host, Cyril Hanouna.
Dude is always saying the same shitty expressions, over and over and over and over.
This interactive bingo game allows viewers of the show to play along while watching, checking off squares corresponding to typical phrases or recurring moments from the show.

The project is developed in JavaScript and is designed to be used during the broadcast of the TPMP show. Each bingo square contains a typical phrase uttered by Cyril Hanouna or key moments from the show. When a player checks off all the squares in a row, column, or diagonal, they can click the "Generate a New Board" button to get a new bingo board and continue playing.

## How to Play

1. **Generating the Board**: Upon page load or by clicking the "Generate a New Board" button, a bingo board is generated with typical Cyril Hanouna phrases in each square.

2. **Check the Squares**: During the broadcast of the TPMP show, players can check off squares corresponding to phrases or moments uttered by Cyril Hanouna.

3. **Fill the Board**: When a player has checked off all the squares in a row, column, or diagonal, they can click the "Generate a New Board" button to get a new board and continue playing.

4. **Success**: When all squares are checked, a success message is displayed, accompanied by a shower of confetti to celebrate the player's victory.

## Features

- **Random Board Generation**: Phrases in each square are randomly generated from a list of iconic Cyril Hanouna quotes.
- **Score Tracking**: A score counter displays the number of squares checked.
- **Encouragement Messages**: Encouraging messages are displayed based on the number of squares checked.
- **Confetti Shower**: When all squares are checked, a shower of confetti celebrates the player's win.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The structure, style, and interactivity of the game are developed using these standard web technologies.
- **Confetti.js**: The Confetti.js library is used to create the confetti shower effect when a player wins the game.
